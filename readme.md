--Assignment conclusion--
I have concluded that the CEO's third solution is the best. That is, to create a Twitter-like solution. The idea is to create cards. Each card contains what needs to be done and in which room it needs to be done. When a card is created, it is created for everyone, without the need for updates. Additionally, I have added more features:

-It should be possible to comment on the cards. So you can easily ask questions and get answers, eliminating the need to call around to the staff.
-It should be possible to tag the cards. Tagging a card will make it appear at the top of the list. Also, when a card is tagged, it is tagged for everyone, so you can easily disseminate important information.
-It should be possible to search the cards. This will search based on the titles of the cards, i.e., the room names.
-Anyone will be able to edit and delete cards. This is done because there is no authentication system in place.
